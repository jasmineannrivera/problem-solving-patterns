	 FREQUENCY COUNTERS

	 - The frequency counter algorithmic pattern uses objects to collect values/frequencies of values
	 {value : frequency of value}

	 -This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with strings or arrays
	*/

	 //AN EXAMPLE:

	 //Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has its corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same.

	//same([1,2,3], [4,1,9]) // true
    //same([1,2,3], [1,9]) // false
    //same([1,2,1], [4,4,1]) // false (must be same frequency)
